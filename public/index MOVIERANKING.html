<h1>The Best Movies According to Dani</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Grown ups 1</h3>
<p>I have always loved Grown Ups 1 because it has such simple yet witty humour + a great story with each character having a different storyline</p>

<h3>Split</h3>
<p>Split is one of my favourite movies because it shows and explains the best way what a person suffering from DID (dissociative Identity Disorder) goes through.</p>

<h3>Deadpool</h3>
<p>How can you not love Deadpool?</p>
